Please Do Your Research</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Because I care about you
and anyone else who might read this, I have put a considerable amount of time
on my Saturday today to address this post.  I don’t know exactly, but I’d say
it’s been at least a few of hours I could have been doing something else.  It
takes up 6 pages in my Word document.  Reading this will be a lot faster and
easier than writing it was for me, so please read it and apply these blunt
facts to the poster’s assertions and come to your own conclusions.</span></p>

<p><b>Women are upset at Trump’s naughty words -- they also
bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>If you are unable discriminate
between what is personal, private sexual practice and what is publicly
offensive or illegal sexual behavior, your brain is not working properly.  The
revelation of Trump’s disrespect for women through his unintentional open mike
recording is not only manifest in his words, it is also manifest in his
actions, having been charged and found guilty in two instances in civil
litigation for sexual abuse, one of which cost him $5 million in fines.  The
judge in the Carroll case confirmed that Trump’s offense constituted rape,
which is to say simply, Trump is a convicted rapist.  That is not conjecture or
hyperbole, that is fact.  Do you believe that these things are the same,
committing rape and privately reading sexually explicit material?  Trump’s
words made public are merely a reflection of his sick and demented soul, proven
out by his heinous acts of sexual abuse.</span></p>

<p><b>Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems
women’s rights only matter if those women are liberal.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>This statement is impossible to
confirm and is likely not true, since terms like “all”, “everyone”, “not one”,
etc. are invariably overreaching and serve only to nullify the statement.  But
there is a reason that the feminist movement has no reason to defend Sarah
Sanders.  Sarah Sanders has proven herself to be solidly patriarchal in her
words and her actions, which is directly counter to the core objectives of the
feminist movement.  For feminists to defend Sarah Sanders, it would require
that they abandon their allegiance to the values of the feminist movement.  Why
would someone who is a true feminist ever do that?</span></p>

<p><b>No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out
yet? But wait... there's more... </b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>A complete platitude with
absolutely no basis, and incorporating false statements.  No voter ID laws? 
Seriously?  Although voter requirements are set state-by-state, all states
require that voters be registered.  In order to vote in person, you have to be
on the list of registered voters for your precinct and you have to present
either your voter registration card to identify you on the list or your ID
(e.g., driver’s license) to identify you on the list.  There is more
information at this link about the fallacy of this statement: </span><a
href="https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote">https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote</a><span
style='color:#0070C0'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Also at this link you will find
a list of those persons who are not eligible to vote in US elections, that
includes non-US citizens, but astonishingly, it also includes Donald Trump. 
Convicted felons are not permitted to vote in US elections, which means Donald
Trump is prohibited, even as President, from voting in US elections because he
is a convicted felon.  </span></p>

<p><b>Chelsea Clinton got out of college and got a job at NBC
that paid $900,000 per year. Her mom flies around the country speaking out
about white privilege. And just like that, they went from being against foreign
interference in our elections to allowing non-citizens to vote in our
elections. </b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>I don’t know the details of
Chelsea’s employment.  I won’t argue that there are objectionable practices and
preferential treatments in both the democratic and republican parties.  As for
as speaking out about white privilege goes, here is her position regarding
white privilege and what we should do about it; it does not endorse white
privilege but instead condemns it: </span><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU8PCvdFEm8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU8PCvdFEm8</a><span
style='color:#0070C0'>.  But this statement has no bearing on a person’s views
regarding Donald Trump.  This has nothing to do with Donald Trump.  Donald
Trump is still a convict, found guilty on 34 felony counts, and a convicted
rapist.  He is still a felon and a convicted rapist regardless of what you
think about Hillary Clinton.  And the last sentence in this statement is a
complete lie; “they”, whoever “they” is, never allowed non-US citizens to vote
in US elections.  This is a complete and utter fabrication. </span></p>

<p><b>President Trump’s wall costs less than the Obamacare
website. Let that sink in, America!</b></p>

<p><b>We are one election away from open borders, socialism,
gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally. We are fighting evil.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Complete made-up idiotic
bullshit.  The only people fighting evil right now are those who are trying to
halt the creeping fascism perpetrated by Trump, his polluted government regime,
and the hyper-rich oligarchs engineering and empowering the evil.</span></p>

<p><b>They sent more troops and armament to arrest Roger Stone
than they sent to defend Benghazi.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>What?  How many ICE agents have
“they” sent to arrest and detain US citizens without due process?</span></p>

<p><b>60 years ago, Venezuela was 4th on the world economic
freedom index. Today, they are 179th and their citizens are dying of
starvation. In only 10 years, Venezuela was destroyed by democratic socialism.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Countries that have pursued
significant nationalization of industries and central economic planning, such
as&nbsp;Venezuela&nbsp;under Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, have experienced
severe economic collapse, marked by hyperinflation, food shortages, and a
massive refugee crisis. Critics attribute this to the “socialist policies”,
corruption, and mismanagement.  But be careful to understand that the
definitions you use for “democratic socialism” and “socialist policies” are
extremely important.  Some of the most influential features of Venezuela’s
circumstances are that the nation has been subject to extensive corruption and
mismanagement, as well as nationalization of industry, one of Donald Trump’s
clear objectives.  If you look at many of the Nordic nations operating under
democratic socialism, they are some of the most stable, affluent, and happy
nations on the planet, but they operate within democratic socialism (socialism
empowered by the community of the nation, the voters), not nationalist,
authoritarian socialism (socialism empowered by oligarchy and the government,
fascism).  Both called “socialism”, yet two entirely different things.</span></p>

<p><b>Russia donated $0.00 to the Trump campaign. Russia
donated $145,600,000 to the Clinton Foundation. But Trump was the one
investigated!</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>There is&nbsp;no evidence
whatsoever that the Russian government itself donated money to the Clinton
Foundation.&nbsp; Check your sources!  Also, there would be no reason for
Russia to donate to Trump’s campaign.  Russia already owns Trump.  It would be a
complete waste of money.</span></p>

<p><b>Nancy Pelosi invited illegal aliens to the State of the
Union. President Trump Invited victims of illegal aliens to the State of the
Union. Let that sink in.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Speaker Pelosi’s invitations
were part of an effort to put a human face on the immigration debate and
highlight the need for legislative action to provide a pathway to citizenship
for those brought to the U.S. as children. The practice of members of Congress
inviting &quot;dreamers&quot; as guests has occurred several times over the
years.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Donald Trump knows how important
his words about unauthorized immigrants are.  “Migrant criminals.” “Illegal
monster.” “Killers.” “Gang members.” “Poisoning our country.” “Taking your
jobs.” “The largest invasion in the history of our country.”  Repetition has
been core to Trump’s speech throughout his political career.  The Marshall
Project&nbsp;used text analysis to identify 13 major claims&nbsp;about
immigration in over 350,000 of Trump’s public statements from&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://factba.se/">Factba.se</a><span style='color:#0070C0'>, some of
which Trump has made 500 times or more.  All of them are untrue or deeply
misleading.  </span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Trump’s invitation of victims of
undocumented immigrants to the State of the Union was his attempt to unfairly
villainize undocumented immigrants.  Studies have shown that the substantial
majority of crimes committed in the US are committed by US citizens, not by
undocumented immigrants.  Pelosi’s motivation to invite undocumented immigrants
was to do good.  Trump’s motivation to invite victims of undocumented
immigrants was to do harm. Let that sink in.</span></p>

<p><b>A socialist is basically a communist who doesn’t have the
power to take everything from their citizens at gunpoint ... Yet! </b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>This is easily the most idiotic
statement in this post.  Please do some reading before swallowing this
nonsense.</span></p>

<p><b>How do you walk 3000 miles across Mexico without food or
support and show up at our border 100 pounds overweight and with a cellphone?</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>What?</span></p>

<p><a><b>Alexandria Ocasio Cortez wants to
ban cars, ban planes, give out universal income </b></a><b>and thinks socialism
works. She calls Donald Trump crazy.</b></p>

<p<span style='color:#0070C0'>Donald Trump is most certainly
insane, by any psychoanalytic measure.  If you want to understand whether or
not democratic socialism works, look into Nordic nations like Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweeden and make up your own mind about whether these nations are
secure, stable, and happy.  </span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez&nbsp;does not&nbsp;want to ban all cars, ban planes, or give out
universal basic income (UBI). Her proposals, particularly the Green New Deal,
aim for a transition to renewable energy and economic reforms, not outright
bans or a UBI.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal
resolution calls for a transition to a&nbsp;net-zero carbon emissions economy,
not the elimination of all emissions immediately.&nbsp;The plan proposes
&quot;overhauling transportation systems&quot; by expanding electric vehicle
manufacturing and building charging stations to reduce reliance on fossil
fuels. It focuses on making electric cars more common, not banning personal
vehicles.  The resolution mentions the goal of expanding high-speed rail to a
&quot;scale where air travel stops becoming necessary&quot; in the long term,
due to emissions concerns, but does not call for an immediate ban on planes.
Staff background summaries clarified the goal is net-zero emissions,
acknowledging that some air travel emissions might still exist in the short term.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Ocasio-Cortez has not proposed a
universal basic income. Her economic proposals focus on an anti-poverty package
called &quot;A Just Society&quot; and the Green New Deal's call for
a&nbsp;federal jobs guarantee&nbsp;with a &quot;family-sustaining wage&quot;
for all Americans who want one. This differs from UBI, which typically provides
a regular, unconditional cash payment to all citizens regardless of employment
status. Her proposals aim to expand access to existing benefits and create
jobs, not provide a universal basic income.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Please do your research before
posting this imbecilic nonsense.  These posts are not helping anything, they
are only causing harm.</span></p>

<p><b>Bill Clinton paid $850,000 to Paula Jones To get her to
go away. I don’t remember the FBI raiding his lawyer’s office.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>What?  What does this have to do
with Trump’s fitness for the office of President?  Who cares about Bill
Clinton?  We’re talking about Donald Trump!  Donald Trump's former lawyer,
Michael Cohen, paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016, which
was later reimbursed by Trump, to keep her from discussing a sexual affair
before the 2016 election. This was a &quot;hush money&quot; payment. Trump
admitted to authorizing the reimbursement.  So, do you believe that it was
unacceptable for Bill Clinton to make his embarrassing situation go away, but
it was OK for Trump to do the same thing?  Please pick a criticism and apply it
consistently.</span></p>

<p><b>I wake up every day and I am grateful that Hillary
Clinton is not the president of the United States of America. The same media
that told me Hillary Clinton had a 95% chance of winning, now tells me Trump’s
approval ratings are low.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>As of early November 2025,
Donald Trump's approval ratings from recent polls generally range from&nbsp;37%
to 41% approval, with disapproval ratings often in the 56% to 63% range.&nbsp;
These ratings are gathered from a number of independent surveys conducted by
organizations with no affiliation to any political party.  The numbers are not
influenced by any prejudice and are reliable.  I honestly believe that the
numbers for Trump’s approval essentially reflect a measure of American
ignorance and stupidity, but that’s just my opinion.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>The media does not pick winners
during elections, the voters do, and the candidate with the most electoral
college votes prevails.  But, this observation about the media’s failure in
it’s prediction about Hillary Clinton’s win is fair; the media really screwed
that one up, which should be a lesson to us all about what we see in the media
and how unreliable that information can be at times.  In my opinion, the media
learned a lesson from that election and has since tightened up its position on
making predictions.  Today’s media is not exactly the same as it was in 2015.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Not all media is equal.  The
approval ratings above are not from Fox News or NBC, they are polls from
organizations that have no prospect of benefit from exaggerating figures in
either direction.  You can believe those numbers, and you should question why
they aren’t zero percent approval for Donald Trump, our rapist felon President.</span></p>

<p><b>“The problem with socialism is that sooner or later you
run out of other people’s money.”— Margaret Thatcher.</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>I love Maggie, but this was a
very stupid thing to say.  Again, not all socialism is the same.  What kind of
socialism was she talking about?  Again, look at the Nordic nations, they have
not run out of money, not by a long shot.  Maggie’s comment is reflective of
her own personal bias and a poorly defined definition for socialism.</span></p>

<p><a name="_Hlk213500526"><b>Maxine Waters opposes voter ID
laws</b></a><b>; She thinks that they are racist. <a name="_Hlk213500807">You
need to have a photo ID to attend her town hall meetings.</a></b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>This is a rash and incorrect
generalization of a position that is much more nuanced than we are led to
believe from the statement. Do your fact-checking and your own thinking here: </span><a
href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/21/facebook-posts/no-only-reason-oppose-voter-id-laws-isnt-because-y/"><span

style='color:#0070C0'>.  Also, It is unlikely you need a photo ID to attend a
Maxine Waters town hall meeting, as there is no general rule requiring one for
town halls, and the specific requirements depend on the event organizer. While
the format of town halls can vary, most are open to the public.  But even if ID
is required for her town hall meetings, what’s the issue?  </span></p>

<p><b>President Trump said — &quot;They’re not after me.
They’re after you. I’m just in their way.&quot; </b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>First of all, who are “they”? 
What does that mean?  He is reinforcing your belief that ”they” are out to get
you, whoever “they” are, and the only thing standing between you and “them” is
him.  He is posing as your great protector.  This is just manipulative
propaganda feeding on insecurity.</span></p>

<p><b>Now, go Back &amp; Read this Again like your Future
Depends upon it, Because it Does!</b></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>I’ve read this pretty carefully
and I’m sure that it is nothing more than an inflammatory piece of garbage that
is not only not helpful, but is littered with untruths, rash generalization,
and falsehoods that only serve to misinform the reader, but also perpetuate the
perception that Trump is being unfairly characterized.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Also, by the way, the poster,
Wayne DeLoriea, is not the author of this post.  Neither is Tim Allen, as the
photograph leads you to believe.  So this poster is in fact plagiarizing the
work of someone else.  The original post was made by someone who identified
himself as “Tim Allen”,  but it was not the actor whose image appears at the
top of the post.  This is not a new post, this post dates back to September of
2019.  At that time, the post was investigated and debunked by Snopes.  So you
have reposted complete trash, thereby wasting the time of anyone who may have
read it.  You can read more about the debunked Facebook post here: </span><a

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>I don’t know if this has been
helpful or enlightening or not.  </span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>It’s been said that it is far
easier to fool someone than it is to convince that person they have been
fooled.  It sounds to me like you have been fooled, so your exposure to these
compelling truths may have no effect, but I really hope that it does.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>People will generally accept
facts as truth only if those facts agree with what they already believe.  I
know these facts contradict what you already believe, so you may not accept
them, but I hope you do accept these undeniable blunt facts as actual truth and
compare them with what you think you understand.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Nietzsche tells us that
sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their
illusions destroyed, and I believe him.  My hope is that you will be more
attracted to the truth than to what you want to believe.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>Mark Twain once said that the
truth has no defense against someone determined to believe a lie.  I hope that
he is at least occasionally wrong about that, and that sometimes truth is
compelling enough to overcome a person’s determination to disbelieve it.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>And Arthur
Schopenhauer&nbsp;tells us that the discovery of truth is prevented more
effectively, not by the false appearance of things present and which mislead
into error, not directly by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by
preconceived opinion, by prejudice.  I’m hoping that you can abandon any
preconceived opinion and open your mind to the blunt facts.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>If you are unable to open your
mind to these truths, then sadly, all of these people were right.  Let’s hope
for the best.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:#0070C0'>I do love you, but if I
see another horrifically ignorant repost like this from you in my feed, I will
block any further posts. Please wake up and pay attention to what is actually
happening, and stop reading and reposting ignorant, untruthful nonsense.  I’ve
put a good deal of time and energy into addressing this post in the hope that
you will take this to heart and investigate further.  Just like you told me in
a previous post, “do your research”.  Peace.</span></p>
