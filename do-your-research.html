<p><strong>Women are upset at Trump&rsquo;s naughty words -- they also bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>If you are unable discriminate between what is personal, private sexual practice and what is publicly offensive or illegal sexual behavior, your brain is not working properly.&nbsp; The revelation of Trump&rsquo;s disrespect for women through his unintentional open mike recording is not only manifest in his words, it is also manifest in his actions, having been charged and found guilty in two instances in civil litigation for sexual abuse, one of which cost him $5 million in fines.&nbsp; The judge in the Carroll case confirmed that Trump&rsquo;s offense constituted rape, which is to say simply, Trump is a convicted rapist.&nbsp; That is not conjecture or hyperbole, that is fact.&nbsp; Do you believe that these things are the same, committing rape and privately reading sexually explicit material?&nbsp; Trump&rsquo;s words made public are merely a reflection of his sick and demented soul, proven out by his heinous acts of sexual abuse.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Not one feminist has defended Sarah Sanders. It seems women&rsquo;s rights only matter if those women are liberal.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>This statement is impossible to confirm and is likely not true, since terms like &ldquo;all&rdquo;, &ldquo;everyone&rdquo;, &ldquo;not one&rdquo;, etc. are invariably overreaching and serve only to nullify the statement.&nbsp; But there is a reason that the feminist movement has no reason to defend Sarah Sanders.&nbsp; Sarah Sanders has proven herself to be solidly patriarchal in her words and her actions, which is directly counter to the core objectives of the feminist movement.&nbsp; For feminists to defend Sarah Sanders, it would require that they abandon their allegiance to the values of the feminist movement.&nbsp; Why would someone who is a true feminist ever do that?</em></span></p>

<p><strong>No Border Walls. No voter ID laws. Did you figure it out yet? But wait... there's more... </strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>A complete platitude with absolutely no basis, and incorporating false statements.&nbsp; No voter ID laws?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Although voter requirements are set state-by-state, all states require that voters be registered.&nbsp; In order to vote in person, you have to be on the list of registered voters for your precinct and you have to present either your voter registration card to identify you on the list or your ID (e.g., driver&rsquo;s license) to identify you on the list.&nbsp; There is more information at this link about the fallacy of this statement: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote">https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote</a></span>.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Also at this link you will find a list of those persons who are not eligible to vote in US elections, that includes non-US citizens, but astonishingly, it also includes Donald Trump.&nbsp; Convicted felons are not permitted to vote in US elections, which means Donald Trump is prohibited, even as President, from voting in US elections because he is a convicted felon.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Chelsea Clinton got out of college and got a job at NBC that paid $900,000 per year. Her mom flies around the country speaking out about white privilege. And just like that, they went from being against foreign interference in our elections to allowing non-citizens to vote in our elections. </strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>I don&rsquo;t know the details of Chelsea&rsquo;s employment.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t argue that there are objectionable practices and preferential treatments in both the democratic and republican parties.&nbsp; As for as speaking out about white privilege goes, here is her position regarding white privilege and what we should do about it; it does not endorse white privilege but instead condemns it: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU8PCvdFEm8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU8PCvdFEm8</a></span>. &nbsp;But this statement has no bearing on a person&rsquo;s views regarding Donald Trump.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with Donald Trump.&nbsp; Donald Trump is still a convict, found guilty on 34 felony counts, and a convicted rapist.&nbsp; He is still a felon and a convicted rapist regardless of what you think about Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; And the last sentence in this statement is a complete lie; &ldquo;they&rdquo;, whoever &ldquo;they&rdquo; is, never allowed non-US citizens to vote in US elections.&nbsp; This is a complete and utter fabrication.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>We are one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion nationally. We are fighting evil.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Complete made-up idiotic bullshit.&nbsp; The only people fighting evil right now are those who are trying to halt the creeping fascism perpetrated by Trump, his polluted government regime, and the hyper-rich oligarchs engineering and empowering the evil.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>They sent more troops and armament to arrest Roger Stone than they sent to defend Benghazi.</strong></p>

<p><strong>60 years ago, Venezuela was 4th on the world economic freedom index. Today, they are 179th and their citizens are dying of starvation. In only 10 years, Venezuela was destroyed by democratic socialism.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Countries that have pursued significant nationalization of industries and central economic planning, such as&nbsp;Venezuela&nbsp;under Hugo Ch&aacute;vez and Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, have experienced severe economic collapse, marked by hyperinflation, food shortages, and a massive refugee crisis. Critics attribute this to the &ldquo;socialist policies&rdquo;, corruption, and mismanagement.&nbsp; But be careful to understand that the definitions you use for &ldquo;democratic socialism&rdquo; and &ldquo;socialist policies&rdquo; are extremely important.&nbsp; Some of the most influential features of Venezuela&rsquo;s circumstances are that the nation has been subject to extensive corruption and mismanagement, as well as nationalization of industry, one of Donald Trump&rsquo;s clear objectives.&nbsp; If you look at many of the Nordic nations operating under democratic socialism, they are some of the most stable, affluent, and happy nations on the planet, but they operate within democratic socialism (socialism empowered by the community of the nation, the voters), not nationalist, authoritarian socialism (socialism empowered by oligarchy and the government, fascism).&nbsp; Both called &ldquo;socialism&rdquo;, yet two entirely different things.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Russia donated $0.00 to the Trump campaign. Russia donated $145,600,000 to the Clinton Foundation. But Trump was the one investigated!</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>There is&nbsp;no evidence whatsoever that the Russian government itself donated money to the Clinton Foundation.&nbsp; Check your sources!&nbsp; Also, there would be no reason for Russia to donate to Trump&rsquo;s campaign.&nbsp; Russia already owns Trump.&nbsp; It would be a complete waste of money.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Nancy Pelosi invited illegal aliens to the State of the Union. President Trump Invited victims of illegal aliens to the State of the Union. Let that sink in.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Speaker Pelosi&rsquo;s invitations were part of an effort to put a human face on the immigration debate and highlight the need for legislative action to provide a pathway to citizenship for those brought to the U.S. as children. The practice of members of Congress inviting "dreamers" as guests has occurred several times over the years.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Donald Trump knows how important his words about unauthorized immigrants are.&nbsp; &ldquo;Migrant criminals.&rdquo; &ldquo;Illegal monster.&rdquo; &ldquo;Killers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gang members.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poisoning our country.&rdquo; &ldquo;Taking your jobs.&rdquo; &ldquo;The largest invasion in the history of our country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Repetition has been core to Trump&rsquo;s speech throughout his political career. &nbsp;The Marshall Project&nbsp;used text analysis to identify 13 major claims&nbsp;about immigration in over 350,000 of Trump&rsquo;s public statements from&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://factba.se/">Factba.se</a></span>, some of which Trump has made 500 times or more. &nbsp;All of them are untrue or deeply misleading.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Trump&rsquo;s invitation of victims of undocumented immigrants to the State of the Union was his attempt to unfairly villainize undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; Studies have shown that the substantial majority of crimes committed in the US are committed by US citizens, not by undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; Pelosi&rsquo;s motivation to invite undocumented immigrants was to do good.&nbsp; Trump&rsquo;s motivation to invite victims of undocumented immigrants was to do harm.

<p><strong>Alexandria Ocasio Cortez wants to ban cars, ban planes, give out universal income </strong><strong>and thinks socialism works. She calls Donald Trump crazy.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Donald Trump is most certainly insane, by any psychoanalytic measure.&nbsp; If you want to understand whether or not democratic socialism works, look into Nordic nations like Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweeden and make up your own mind about whether these nations are secure, stable, and happy.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&nbsp;does not&nbsp;want to ban all cars, ban planes, or give out universal basic income (UBI). Her proposals, particularly the Green New Deal, aim for a transition to renewable energy and economic reforms, not outright bans or a UBI.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal resolution calls for a transition to a&nbsp;net-zero carbon emissions economy, not the elimination of all emissions immediately.&nbsp;The plan proposes "overhauling transportation systems" by expanding electric vehicle manufacturing and building charging stations to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. It focuses on making electric cars more common, not banning personal vehicles.&nbsp; The resolution mentions the goal of expanding high-speed rail to a "scale where air travel stops becoming necessary" in the long term, due to emissions concerns, but does not call for an immediate ban on planes. Staff background summaries clarified the goal is net-zero emissions, acknowledging that some air travel emissions might still exist in the short term.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Ocasio-Cortez has not proposed a universal basic income. Her economic proposals focus on an anti-poverty package called "A Just Society" and the Green New Deal's call for a&nbsp;federal jobs guarantee&nbsp;with a "family-sustaining wage" for all Americans who want one. This differs from UBI, which typically provides a regular, unconditional cash payment to all citizens regardless of employment status. Her proposals aim to expand access to existing benefits and create jobs, not provide a universal basic income.&nbsp;</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Bill Clinton paid $850,000 to Paula Jones To get her to go away. I don&rsquo;t remember the FBI raiding his lawyer&rsquo;s office.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>What?&nbsp; What does this have to do with Trump&rsquo;s fitness for the office of President?&nbsp; Who cares about Bill Clinton?&nbsp; We&rsquo;re talking about Donald Trump!&nbsp; Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016, which was later reimbursed by Trump, to keep her from discussing a sexual affair before the 2016 election. This was a "hush money" payment. Trump admitted to authorizing the reimbursement.&nbsp; So, do you believe that it was unacceptable for Bill Clinton to make his embarrassing situation go away, but it was OK for Trump to do the same thing?&nbsp; Please pick a criticism and apply it consistently.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>I wake up every day and I am grateful that Hillary Clinton is not the president of the United States of America. The same media that told me Hillary Clinton had a 95% chance of winning, now tells me Trump&rsquo;s approval ratings are low.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>As of early November 2025, Donald Trump's approval ratings from recent polls generally range from&nbsp;37% to 41% approval, with disapproval ratings often in the 56% to 63% range.&nbsp; These ratings are gathered from a number of independent surveys conducted by organizations with no affiliation to any political party.&nbsp; The numbers are not influenced by any prejudice and are reliable.&nbsp; I honestly believe that the numbers for Trump&rsquo;s approval essentially reflect a measure of American ignorance and stupidity, but that&rsquo;s just my opinion.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>The media does not pick winners during elections, the voters do, and the candidate with the most electoral college votes prevails. &nbsp;But, this observation about the media&rsquo;s failure in it&rsquo;s prediction about Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s win is fair; the media really screwed that one up, which should be a lesson to us all about what we see in the media and how unreliable that information can be at times.&nbsp; In my opinion, the media learned a lesson from that election and has since tightened up its position on making predictions.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s media is not exactly the same as it was in 2015.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>Not all media is equal.&nbsp; The approval ratings above are not from Fox News or NBC, they are polls from organizations that have no prospect of benefit from exaggerating figures in either direction.&nbsp; You can believe those numbers, and you should question why they aren&rsquo;t zero percent approval for Donald Trump, our rapist felon President.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The problem with socialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;&mdash; Margaret Thatcher.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>I loved Maggie, but this was a very stupid thing to say.&nbsp; Again, not all socialism is the same.&nbsp; What kind of socialism was she talking about?&nbsp; Again, look at the Nordic nations, they have not run out of money, not by a long shot.&nbsp; Maggie&rsquo;s comment is reflective of her own personal bias and a poorly defined definition for socialism.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Maxine Waters opposes voter ID laws</strong><strong>; She thinks that they are racist. You need to have a photo ID to attend her town hall meetings.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><em>This is a rash and incorrect generalization of a position that is much more nuanced than we are led to believe from the statement.
